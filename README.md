## Description
This weeks challenge was to rebuild our portfolio using React.JS. React is a popular Single-Page Application, or SPA, language that a lot of big companies like to use. Apps are popularly built in React because of their effciency when loading. Users will see quick load times beteen pages and also functional responsiveness across media devices. In my personal portfolio users can navigate between four pages, the "About", "Portfolio", "Contact" and "Resum√©" pages. All of these pages load quickly and effciently thanks to React.


## Installation
Run 'npm i' in the command line to install all the necessary dependencies.
